# SudokuProject-COMP271
This is a Sudoku Puzzle project created for our COMP271 class. It was programmed by myself, @rilesmeow, and Jess Conway. Our goal with this project was to not only get our feet wet with programming a frontend (implemented SFML), but to more importantly understand the Backtrack algorithm.
